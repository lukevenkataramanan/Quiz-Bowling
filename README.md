# Quiz-Bowling
Quiz bowling is a game I created to make studying flashcards fun!

Usually memorizing facts is quite repetitive and boring, so I combined studying with the experience of playing video games!

I created the images myself using an online pixel art editor, and the database for the questions is from an Excel sheet. The database for the leaderboard is stored in a text file.

Check out my YouTube video showcasing the project. Also feel free to check out my other videos!
